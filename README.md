This repository contains the source code and documentation for the **Intelligent Shopping Agent**, a project developed by Team 82 at Marathwada Mitra Mandal’s Institute of Technology. This agent is designed to overcome information overload in the modern e-commerce landscape by acting as a personalized, 24/7 automated assistant.

## 🚀 Project Overview
In today's e-commerce market, consumers often face "choice paralysis" due to scattered product information and rapidly changing prices across platforms. Our Intelligent Shopping Agent consolidates data from multiple sources to help users make informed, cost-effective decisions efficiently.

### Key Features

**Real-time Price Transparency:** Scrapes and compares prices across platforms to ensure users find the lowest cost.
* 


**Personalized Suggestions:** Learns user preferences and budget to offer tailored product recommendations
* 


**Granular Accuracy:** Utilizes an Intent Parser to avoid generic search results and focus on specific user needs.
* 


**Structured Advice:** Converts messy web data into clean, readable shopping advice through specialized extraction agents.
